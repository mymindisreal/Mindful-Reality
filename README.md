Hello!  My name is TheOeasy.  I am a US Army veteran.  I served 15 months in Iraq as a combat medic.  I love computers and have been building them since I was 12 years old when we still had to dial into AOL!  I created an online Virtual Airline when I was 14 that had over 100 pilots that I managed flights and traffic control.  My Virtual Airline (VA) EastAir was well known and I was interviewed at that young age for the web and graphic development, pilot management, and overall VA success I had with EastAir on an online radio station with over 2 million listeners!  

I also worked as a Registered Nurse in Atlanta in an emergency center after becoming a civilian.  I am Army enlisted and officer trained.  I am currently pursuing my masters in IT through Kaplan (hold comments pls!) and also another Associates Degree of Science in Information Technology at Northeast Georgia Technical College.  w

Through Udacity I hope to increase my knowledge of computers and programming and land a job in the tech field, possibly in Health Informatics or an IT department of a large hospital!

Thanks for listening!
